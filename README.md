# PowerBox Project

## Overview

The high cost of importation and capital costs of imported renewable energy systems are restricting access to products that would give consumers the options they need to adopt affordable solutions that suit their needs. There is thus a need to lower the costs of such systems through local innovation and production. 

This project aims to develop a solar + wind powered **PowerBox** that can power basic appliances in the homes of low and medium-class families and micro and small businesses. A key challenge of this project is the product's affordability to the targeted group. 

This project builds on the results of engagement with an existing prototype created from past research development works. Feedback from engagement includes the need for increased power output without losing the affordability factor and a more practical body design.
